# ðŸš€ My Journey: From WordPress to MERN Stack & Beyond!

Welcome to my repository! This space is dedicated to documenting my daily progress as I transition from a seasoned **WordPress Developer** to a **MERN Stack Developer**â€”and ultimately, a **Software Engineer**.

## ðŸŒ± Why this Journey?

After over two years of successfully building and managing WordPress sites, I'm now diving deeper into modern web development technologies. My goal is to become proficient in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and continue evolving into a well-rounded software engineer.

## ðŸ’¡ My Vision

This isn't just a career switchâ€”it's a roadmap toward something greater. My journey doesn't stop at mastering the MERN stack. The final destination? Landing a role at **Google**, where I can apply my full spectrum of skills to solve impactful, global challenges.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals:
- Daily progress tracking in MERN stack development.
- Building full-stack applications from scratch.
- Sharpening my software engineering principles.
- Preparing for software engineering roles at world-class tech companies.

## ðŸ“ˆ Let's build something amazing!

Feel free to explore the projects and code samples here. They represent the steps along my journey from **WordPress** to **MERN Stack**, with every line of code bringing me closer to my ultimate goal!
